This is a simple code sample that shows how to make irregular shaped user interface windows
using PyQt5 module.  I would imagine it's similiar in PyQt6/Pyside6 as well.  This is a very clear and concise
method to do it and includes mouse events for when the top of the UI is clicked and moved so that the
user can move the UI around.  Doing searches on google, I could not actually find a very concise and clear 
method for doing this, which is why im posting it here, all the code samples I could find were much more convoluted.
